1. Amazon Fine Food Reviews:  

This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon. It was collected over a period of 10 years and includes 
reviews up to October 2012. The dataset contains information about a product, the userid, the profile name for the name of the user and 
some information about the reviews that were posted by them. 

The helpfulness numerator is the number of users who found the review useful, the helpfulness deniminator happens to be the opposite. 
The score is the score that was given by the customer. A review contains a title/summary and the text/review.

I made use of Python to visualize wordclouds to understand which words seemed to stand out to most.

I also wanted to see if they seemed to express a positive or negative sentiment.

I made use of logistic regression to predict the sentiment of a review.

The results can be found in the "Kaggle - Amazon Fine Food Reviews-2.ipynb" notebook.
